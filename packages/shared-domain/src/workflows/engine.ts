// The workflow engine: turn a parsed `Workflow` into a `RunPlan`.
//
// The invariant that shapes every line below is that this module NEVER writes.
// It reads the vault through `VaultReader` (which has no write method) and
// returns `WorkflowOp`s for the caller to apply. Dry run is therefore not a flag
// somebody can forget to pass, it is the only thing the engine is able to do.
//
// Four rules keep the rest of the file honest:
//
//   1. Nothing throws. A missing arg, an uncompilable pattern, an unknown wire,
//      a reader that rejects: each becomes a `Diagnostic` and the plan carries
//      on. A half-written workflow still has to plan, because the canvas draws
//      the plan and the author is editing while looking at it.
//   2. A step that cannot be evaluated never *widens* the note set. It yields
//      the empty set (an unevaluable filter matches nothing) or aborts the rest
//      of that one pipeline. The engine must never invent a write the author did
//      not ask for, and every failure mode is chosen with that in mind.
//   3. A statement that raised an ERROR contributes no ops at all. Rule 2 hands
//      a broken filter the empty set, and an empty set is a perfectly good thing
//      to render, so `all | where title matches [unclosed | write "Report.md"`
//      planned a zero-byte overwrite of the report right next to the diagnostic
//      saying the filter never ran. The diagnostics survive, the writes do not.
//      A wire that is genuinely empty and raised nothing still writes, because
//      an empty report is a report somebody asked for. The limits go through the
//      same rule: a run stopped by `maxOps` or `maxDepth` leaves behind the
//      statements that fitted whole, and never half of one, so a note can never
//      end up with the first of its two tags and not the second.
//   4. Note bodies are read lazily, only for steps whose `NodeDef.needsBody` is
//      set, only for the notes actually on the wire at that point, and cached
//      for the whole run including across `call` recursion. A `where` over 5000
//      notes therefore touches disk exactly zero times.
//
// Statements are executed in dependency order rather than file order, so an
// author can reference a wire defined lower down. Cycles are a static error
// (see `validate`), but a resolver that changes between runs can still build one
// dynamically, which is what `maxDepth` and `maxOps` are for.
