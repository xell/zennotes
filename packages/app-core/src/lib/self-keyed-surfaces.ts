/**
 * Surfaces that run their own keyboard, which the global VimNav listener must
 * not touch.
 *
 * VimNav's handler is CAPTURE-PHASE on window and calls
 * stopImmediatePropagation, so by default it wins every key in the app and
 * routes it into sidebar and note-list navigation. Any panel with its own
 * focus and its own keys has to be excluded there, and forgetting does not
 * look like a routing bug: the panel simply appears to have no keyboard at
 * all. Both Workflows surfaces shipped with exactly that symptom (arrows
 * moved the SIDEBAR cursor, Backspace "focused the left sidebar", m opened
 * the sidebar folder menu), and each was diagnosed from scratch because the
 * previous fix was an anonymous copy of the same three lines.
 *
 * One list and one condition, so a new surface is one entry rather than a
 * fourth near-identical block, and the Ctrl+W passthrough cannot be got wrong
 * per surface. Ctrl+W and its pending direction key always survive, so a
 * panel can still hand off to pane and tab navigation.
 *
 * The list is shared with `setFocusedPanel`: the yield means a store
 * `focusedPanel` that disagrees with DOM focus makes the app deaf (the
 * sidebar renders its vim cursor and `m` hint while the grid quietly keeps
 * every key), so handing the keyboard to the sidebar must also release DOM
 * focus from these surfaces.
