An **override** is a small CSS file that layers on top of whichever theme is active, toggled on or off under Settings → Appearance → Overrides. Reach for a theme to design a whole look; reach for an override to change one or two things — a different accent, a darker background — without forking a theme. Both apply live, no restart.'

Edits to `theme.css` apply live. Only the active theme CSS is loaded, so write `:root { … }` for the light/shared values and `:root[data-theme-mode="dark"] { … }` for dark — you never put the theme name in a selector. Colors are the `--z-*` tokens, written as space-separated RGB (`--z-accent: 255 59 48;`): backgrounds `--z-bg` / `--z-bg-softer` / `--z-bg-1`…`--z-bg-4`, text `--z-fg-1` / `--z-fg-2` / `--z-grey-0`…`--z-grey-2`, accent `--z-accent` / `--z-accent-soft` / `--z-accent-muted`, and the syntax hues `--z-red` / `--z-green` / `--z-yellow` / `--z-blue` / `--z-purple` / `--z-aqua`. `manifest.json` carries name, author, version, description, `modes` (light | dark | both), and an optional preview swatch.'

    title: 'Override one thing on any theme',
    body:
      'An override is a `.css` file in `~/.config/zennotes/overrides/`, toggled under Settings → Appearance → Overrides. Enabled overrides inject on top of the active theme in filename order, so they win the cascade — target `:root[data-theme] { … }` so the rule beats both built-in and custom themes. Because they sit on top, one override re-themes everything: `:root[data-theme] { --z-accent: 255 59 48; }` turns the accent hot pink on every theme. Overrides stack, so keep several small ones and flip each independently. The seeded `example.css` is a commented cookbook with the full token list and ready-to-uncomment recipes. To find what controls an element, use the **Developer tools** button in that same Overrides section and inspect it.'

Remote http/https URLs are never loaded, so themes stay self-contained and work offline; small images can also be inlined as `data:` URIs.
