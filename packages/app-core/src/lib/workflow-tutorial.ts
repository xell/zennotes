// The guided Workflows tutorial: real material, real actions, full cleanup.
//
// Workflows are learned by running one, so the tutorial does not simulate
// anything: it seeds a small practice library into the CURRENT vault, walks
// the user through the actual view (canvas, text, inspector, activation, the
// dry-run confirmation, apply, undo), and then removes every trace of itself.
//
// Two rules make that safe:
//
//   1. Everything the tutorial creates lives under ONE folder
//      (`inbox/Workflow tutorial`) plus one workflow file, and the practice
//      workflow reads and writes ONLY inside that folder. The user's own notes
//      are unreachable by construction, not by care.
//   2. Cleanup is a bulk delete of that namespace (folder, workflow file, run
//      ledgers), so it cannot miss anything a run created inside it, and
//      seeding starts with a cleanup so a tutorial abandoned by a crash never
//      leaves two copies behind.
