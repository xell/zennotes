/**
 * macOS-only Vim keymap conflict (`Ctrl-d` deletes instead of half-page-down).
 *
 * `@codemirror/commands`' `defaultKeymap` folds in the emacs-style control
 * chords as **mac-only** bindings (each entry's `mac` field). On macOS that
 * makes the editor bind, among others:
 *
 *   Ctrl-d → deleteCharForward     Ctrl-a → cursorLineStart
 *   Ctrl-e → cursorLineEnd         Ctrl-f → cursorCharRight
 *   Ctrl-b → cursorCharLeft        Ctrl-v → cursorPageDown   …
 *
 * These collide with Vim's own normal/visual-mode chords (`<C-d>` half-page
 * down, `<C-a>` increment, `<C-v>` visual-block, `<C-f>`/`<C-b>` page, …).
 * Because the keymap's key handler runs at higher precedence than the Vim
 * plugin's, the emacs action wins — so in Vim mode on macOS `Ctrl-d` deletes a
 * character instead of scrolling. (Linux/Windows are unaffected: these bindings
 * are mac-only. `Ctrl-u`, which has no emacs binding, already worked — hence the
 * up/down asymmetry users notice.)
 *
 * The fix is to drop these chords from the editor keymap while Vim mode is on,
 * so Vim receives them and handles them natively. When Vim is off we keep them —
 * they're standard macOS text-editing keys.

 * `deleteCharBackward`; and (like the mac emacs chords above) the keymap's
 * handler runs at higher precedence than the Vim plugin's. So in Vim mode the
 * arrows just move the caret — which in *visual* mode collapses the selection
 * instead of extending it the way `h`/`j`/`k`/`l` do (issue #287) — and Enter/
 * Backspace *edit the text* in normal mode instead of applying Vim's `<CR>`/
 * `<BS>` motions. `hjkl` have no competing keymap binding, so they were never
 * affected — hence the asymmetry users hit.
 *
 * Unlike the emacs chords we can't simply drop these keys: Vim only maps them
 * in normal/visual mode (`<Left>`→`h`, `<CR>`→`j^`, …), not in *insert* mode,
 * so insert-mode caret movement, newline insertion and deletion still rely on
 * these bindings. Instead, in Vim mode each binding defers to the Vim plugin
 * while Vim is in a non-insert mode — returning `false` with no
 * `preventDefault` lets the keypress fall through to the (lower-precedence)
 * Vim plugin, which then applies the motion. Insert mode (and Vim-off) keep
 * the native behavior. Shift-modified handlers are left untouched.
