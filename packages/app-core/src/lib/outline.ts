/**
 * Extract the heading outline from a markdown note body.
 *
 * Covers ATX headings (`# Title` through `###### Title`) with three
 * practical rules:
 *   - Skip a leading YAML frontmatter block (`---` … `---`), so the
 *     closing `---` isn't read as a setext underline that turns the
 *     last frontmatter line into a phantom H2 (#442).
 *   - Skip headings inside fenced code blocks (``` or ~~~), so code
 *     snippets that start lines with `#` don't pollute the outline.
 *   - Accept setext-style underline headings (`Title\n====`) and
 *     normalize them to level 1 (=) or 2 (-).
 *
 * The `line` field is the 1-based line number so callers can feed it
 * straight to CodeMirror's `doc.line(n)` API. `from` is the 0-based
 * character offset where the heading line starts — useful when the
 * caller already has the full body in hand.
