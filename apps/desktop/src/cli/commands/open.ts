/**
 * `zn open <file.md>` — open one or more markdown files in the ZenNotes
 * desktop app, whether or not they live inside a vault.
 *
 *   zn open ~/Downloads/notes.md
 *   zn open inbox/Today.md other.markdown
 *   zn open inbox/demo/03 — Tables and Task Lists.md   (unquoted is fine)
 *
 * Paths resolve against the current directory first, then the active
 * vault root — so the vault-relative paths `zn list` prints open from
 * anywhere. When the shell has split an unquoted path with spaces into
 * several tokens, we re-join them and try again as a single file.
 *
 * We hand the file paths to the desktop app as launch arguments.
 * Electron's single-instance handling routes them to a running ZenNotes
 * (or starts one), where the open-file logic decides whether each file
 * is a vault note or a standalone file.
