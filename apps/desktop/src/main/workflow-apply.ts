// Applying a workflow run, and taking it back.
//
// The engine plans and never writes (see `@shared/workflows/engine`); this
// module is the only place a planned run reaches disk. Everything below exists
// to keep one promise: after a run, the vault is either exactly what the plan
// said it would be, or exactly what it was before. Never half of each. A run
// the process did not survive is the one case where the vault can be found
// holding half of each, and even then the bytes to put it back are on disk and
// the run is offered as an undo (decision 5).
//
// Five decisions carry that promise:
//
//   1. Undo restores RECORDED BYTES, it never replays a computed inverse. The
//      journal holds `{ path, before }` for every file the run touched, where
//      `before: null` means the path did not exist. Undo writes every `before`
//      back and deletes where null. Per-op inverses would be fifteen separate
//      chances to corrupt a vault; this is one mechanism that is right by
//      construction, and a `move` needs no special case because recording both
//      of its paths already describes how to put it back.
//   2. The journal records the PRE-RUN state, so the first touch of a path
//      wins. A later op editing the same file must not overwrite the entry
//      with a value this very run produced, or undo would restore a half-run.
//   3. A partial failure rolls the WHOLE run back, including the steps that
//      already succeeded. A half-applied workflow is worse than none, because
//      the author cannot tell which half landed. If the rollback itself cannot
//      finish, the receipt says so loudly and names the files: never report
//      success over a vault we could not put back.
//   4. Containment is checked for every path in the plan BEFORE the first byte
//      is written, so one traversal attempt aborts the run untouched rather
//      than leaving a rolled-back mess behind.
//   5. The journal reaches DISK before the write it protects, as a `.jsonl`
//      beside the ledger. In memory it only survives a failure this module can
//      catch; a killed process, a power cut or an OOM would otherwise leave a
//      half-applied vault with no record of what it had been. The next run (or
//      the next look at the history) finds that file, turns it into a ledger
//      marked `interrupted` and offers it as an undo. It does NOT roll back on
//      its own: minutes or days may have passed and the user may have edited
//      since, so putting the vault back is their call, not a surprise on
//      startup. Until they make it, the vault holds whatever the dead run got
//      as far as, which is the one gap in the promise above.
//
// `notify` and `clipboard` are not applied here (the main process is not where
// the user's clipboard and toasts live) and are not journalled. They are
// counted into `receipt.irreversible` so the promise the UI makes about undo
// stays true.

 * Resolve a vault-relative path a workflow wants to write, refusing anything

 *
 * Three separate refusals for three separate reasons:
 *
 *   - Escaping the vault is the obvious one, and it is checked on every path
 *     this module resolves (op targets, computed destinations, and again on
 *     every journal entry at undo time) because a ledger read back from disk
 *     must never become a write primitive pointed anywhere on the filesystem.
 *     The check is TEXTUAL: `path.resolve` normalises `..` away and the result
 *     is required to sit under the root, with no `realpath`. A symlinked
 *     directory (or note) inside the vault therefore still leads a write to
 *     wherever it points. That is deliberate: the rest of the app follows those
 *     links too (`writeNote` is a plain `fs.writeFile`), a vault made of
 *     symlinked folders is a supported setup, and resolving here would make
 *     workflows the one feature that refuses to write notes the user can edit
 *     by hand. What this boundary rules out is a path that NAMES somewhere
 *     else, which is the part an op author or a synced ledger controls.
 *   - `.zennotes` holds this feature's own run ledgers, plus workflows,
 *     templates and settings. A workflow that could write there could rewrite
 *     the record of what it did.
 *   - The extension check keeps a mistyped `write reports/weekly` from either
 *     creating a file the app cannot show, or truncating a binary asset that
 *     this module would then "restore" as mangled UTF-8. Rejecting is the honest
 *     answer: silently appending `.md` would apply something other than the path
 *     the user saw in the dry run.
